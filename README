		   http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/lookup/

Lookup is a search interface with electronic dictionaries for the Emacs
text editor.  You can use various kinds of dictionaries, such as CD-ROM
books and online dictionaries, by simple operations.

How To Install =========================================================

There are two ways to install Lookup.  If you are using XEmacs 21.0 or
later, you can install a binary package of Lookup.  Or else, you can use
the special installer for Lookup.

Using Binary Package
--------------------

This is the best way to install Lookup for XEmacs 21.x users.  Just get
the Lookup binary package (i.e., lookup-x.xx-pkg.tar.gz), and extract it
into your package directory like this:

  % cd ~/.xemacs/packages
  % tar xfz lookup-x.xx-pkg.tar.gz

You can build a binary package from this source archive.  Just type
`make binkit' at the top directory of the archive.

Using Quick Installer
---------------------

You can call the special installer for Lookup directly in your Emacs:

  1. Run Emacs and open the top directory of the archive by Dired.
  2. Type `L' at the line of the file `install.el' and answer yes.
  3. Input your elisp directory and your info directory.

You can also run this installer from shell:

  % emacs -batch -l install.el ~/emacs/lisp/lookup ~/emacs/info

How To Use =============================================================

You need to prepare your dictionaries before using Lookup.  This should
not be so difficult, but may require some more works from you.  To get
